## **About Me**
![K](images/ketchupAndRice.jpg)
Hello I'm Matthew Wakayama, and I am 15 years old. I go to [Del Norte High School](https://delnorte.powayusd.com/). I am currently taking Honors Humanities, Ap Chemistry, Ap Computer Science, and Ap Calculus. Outside of school I swim for a club called [Pacific Swim](https://pacificswim.com/)

Future Plans:
- Create an image carousel for user interaction
- Incorporate python 


<!-- - Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.  -->
